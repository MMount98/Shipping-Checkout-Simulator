# Shipping-Checkout-Simulator

## Introduction
Step into the logistics realm with the "Shipping Checkout Simulator", a Python3 project designed to streamline the checkout process for shipping companies. Crafted with Python's conditional logic in mind, this tool doesn't just serve shipping needsâ€”it doubles as a hands-on guide to understanding the intricacies of if/elif statements and the use of logical operators, like and.

## Features
Dynamic Rate Calculation: Get shipping costs based on a variety of factors, efficiently calculated using if/elif conditions.
Logical Operators in Action: Experience firsthand how the and operator aids in evaluating multiple conditions simultaneously.


## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local workspace.
Navigate to the project directory and run the program with the command python3 shipping_checkout.py.
Input the relevant shipping details as prompted.
Review the calculated shipping cost and proceed to checkout!
